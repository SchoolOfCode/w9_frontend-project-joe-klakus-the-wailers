# Bootcamper Social.

This is the Front End of our Mid-way project for School of Code, we were presented with the task of creating an app that would help a bootcamper through this experience. After some discussion we decided to create an APP centered around meeting other bootcampers outside of Bootcamp Hours.

As of 28/6/2022 the app is not deployed and so you will have to run it locally to view.






## Run Locally

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/w9_frontend-project-joe-klakus-the-wailers.git

## Color Reference

We have created buttons called Constructive Destructive and Neutral. Effectively it is based on the job the button does:

-Constructive generally creates something (A new User, Event or Log In)

-Destructive generally destroys something (Log Out, Delete or Edit Account)

-Neutral is more to do with updating. (Uploading a new picture or logo)

The colours below we hope will explain which is which and what there jobs are in terms of UI/UX

All of Our CSS is in one file (App.css) search through using cntrl + F or cmd + F then search for the styling you want, it is named semantically so to search for the logo styling type in logo and you will be taken to the correct styling section.
