# Bootcamper Social.

This is the Front End of our Mid-way project for School of Code, we were presented with the task of creating an app that would help a bootcamper through this experience. After some discussion we decided to create an APP centered around meeting other bootcampers outside of Bootcamp Hours.

As of 28/6/2022 the app is not deployed and so you will have to run it locally to view.
